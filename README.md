# TeauxDeauxBox

Here at The Turing School of Software and Design, we have a lot on our plate. Sometimes it is difficult to keep track of all of the tasks that you need to complete. With 2-do-box-2, We have attempted to create a seamless, fluid site to manage your TeauxDeaux's.

We relied on JavaScript and jQuery create, save, and filter Todos on the site, and `localStorage` to make sure that you don't forget your tasks between sessions!

## Project Requirements

### Pivot from ideabox

For this project, we were given an ideabox project and tasked with refactoring and pivoting its purpose into a todo box with added functionality. We reduced the lines of code and simplified functions to streamline the javascript and make it more accessible to other developers.

### Added functionality

We created a way to filter the todos by title, text, and quality and included buttons to hide/show completed and incomplete tasks. We made sure that all of the tasks were editable because everyone changes their mind about what/how to accomplish. Once you have completed a todo, your task will disappear from the page on your next session or on page refresh. However, if you want to pat yourself on the back for all of the tasks that you have completed, you can push the "show completed" button and all of your completed tasks will be displayed right at the top.
